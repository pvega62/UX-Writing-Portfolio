# UX Writing Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my UX writing work, with pieces created in Figma. A significant portion of this portfolio was created during my participation in the Daily UX Writing Challenge in 2024. I was given a daily prompt to create a UX writing piece, allowing me to practice and improve my skills.

The challenge gave me the opportunity to explore different types of UX writing, such as microcopy, error messages, and onboarding flows. I could also experiment with different styles and tones of writing, as well as different types of products and services.

I also got to flex some design muscles, as I created these pieces in Figma using the skills I learned in the Google UX Design Professional Certificate program.

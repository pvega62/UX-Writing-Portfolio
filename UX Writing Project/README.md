    A user works in graphic design. While critiquing a design in a mobile app, their phone abruptly turns off. When they restart the phone, they reopen the app. Write a message that the user will read immediately upon opening the app. What do they need to know?

    *   Body: 45 characters max

    The driver has 6 more deliveries before stopping for fuel and lunch. He can choose to stay on his planned route or get fuel and lunch now and finish the deliveries later.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   Headline: 30 characters max
    *   Body: 45 characters max
    *   Button(s): 25 characters max
